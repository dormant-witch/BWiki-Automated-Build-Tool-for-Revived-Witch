Thus she privately still keeps in touch with that man who delivers the latest news of the outside to her, including some news songs. Mayahuel knows nothing about this and even asks Mineer to teach the songs to Flora.\nMineer's elegant manners often lead to an illusion that she has good taste in music but actually she is a bad learner of music. Each time she performs the new song before Mayahuel, she makes a slip-up and stammers in defence, with a modest face entirely different from usual. Luckily Mayahuel is not very suspicious but just curious why Mineer can discover such a great piece of music.",
